class Module:
    """Base class for all udspy modules.

    Modules are composable async-first units. The core method is `aexecute()`
    which handles both streaming and non-streaming execution. Public methods
    `astream()` and `aforward()` are thin wrappers around `aexecute()`.

    Subclasses should implement `aexecute()` to define their behavior.

    Example:
        ```python
        # Async streaming (real-time)
        async for event in module.astream(question="What is AI?"):
            if isinstance(event, StreamChunk):
                print(event.delta, end="", flush=True)
            elif isinstance(event, Prediction):
                result = event

        # Async non-streaming
        result = await module.aforward(question="What is AI?")

        # Sync (for scripts, notebooks)
        result = module(question="What is AI?")
        result = module.forward(question="What is AI?")
